Hi, welcome in this repository! 
</br>
This repository includes files that I used during my project I did while graduating for my bachelor of Science.
Feel free to test things out, or submit changes to this project to improve results.
</br></br>
For this project, I have used several open source datasets.
These are called AU-AIR and Visdrone2019. Besides that, I also webscraped 
data from a YouTube Livestream, which includes images from a webcam video 
based on a high building.
</br>
Some data is already labeled by me, but others aren't yet. If you would like to label the data that is currently unlabelled, you can message me so I can add that new labeled data in the labeled dataset.

These datasets can be pulled from these links:
